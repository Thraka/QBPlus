        NOTES FOR QB PLUS QUICKBASIC PROGRAMMER'S DESK ACCESSORIES


   This file contains additional information that was not available at the
time the QB Plus manual was printed.


OPERATION WITH WINDOWS 3.0
==========================

While not specifically designed to run under Windows, QB Plus will operate
satisfactorily when run from the DOS Prompt or as a non-windows
application, subject to the following limitations and considerations:


1.   All QB Plus features are available in both Windows Real and Standard
     modes.

2.   Profiling is not recommended in Windows 386 Enhanced mode, as multi-
     tasking and paging functions undertaken by Windows can distort the 
     timings made by QB Plus.  Selecting the "Exclusive" option in the 
     .PIF file used to run QB Plus can reduce this effect.  In any event, 
     the higher sampling rates otherwise available via the periodic 
     interrupt feature of an AT-compatible real-time clock are not 
     supported in Windows 386 Enhanced mode.

3.   Viewing of Extended memory is not supported under Windows 386
     Enhanced mode.  Attempts by an application to access extended memory
     directly are intercepted and treated as a "System Integrity Violation"
     by Windows and the offending application is terminated.  Therefore,
     the QB Plus option of "Direct View of Extended memory" must always be
     disabled to ensure QB Plus, along with QuickBASIC and any loaded
     QuickBASIC program, is not abruptly halted when the QB Plus memory 
     viewer is invoked.  QB Plus automatically disables Direct Extended
     memory viewing at startup when run under Windows 386.  You can also
     disable direct viewing with the "/NX" command line argument, or the
     toggle switch in QB Plus' "Change Settings - Other" menu.

4.   Similarly, accessing data in XMS handles "owned" by Windows or another
     application is likewise treated as a "System Integrity Violation" by
     Windows 386 Enhanced.  Therefore, use caution when viewing XMS memory,
     or obtaining a handle list with QB Plus under Windows 386 Enhanced.
     QB Plus will give you a warning which you may override, or disable, 
     when attempting to enter XMS viewing mode.  Proceed at your own risk.
     It is advisable that you first save any loaded QuickBASIC program
     beforehand.

     Note: Windows may not immediately terminate QB Plus when the
     "Violation" (accessing other's XMS data) first occurs.  Rather, the
     termination may happen later when a handle list is requested.  Thus,
     successful viewing of an XMS handle may not necessarily indicate that
     you are secure from a subsequent sudden shutdown.

5.   The file QBPLUS.ICO contains a custom Windows icon for QB Plus.



OPERATION UNDER DESQVIEW
========================

The following is applicable to operation of QB Plus under Desqview:


1.   We suggest that you specify a minimum memory requirement of 348K
     bytes and a keyboard conflict setting of 4 in the .DVP file used
     to start QB Plus.

2.   Profiling is not recommended in DESQview 386, because multi-tasking
     functions undertaken by Desqview can distort the timings made
     by QB Plus.  In any event, the higher sampling rates otherwise
     available via the periodic interrupt feature of an AT-compatible
     real-time clock are not supported in Desqview.



DISABLING OF MOUSE AFTER SWITCHING PROGRAMS
===========================================

After switching to another application program from within QB Plus, the
mouse may become disabled -- that is, the cursor may not respond to mouse
movements, or QuickBASIC does not respond to mouse button clicks.  This
can occur where the application program to which you switched disabled the
mouse on exit.  You can usually restore the mouse function and settings
used by QuickBASIC by shelling to DOS from QuickBASIC, and then returning
to QuickBASIC by typing EXIT at the DOS command line.



CHANGING QB PLUS DISPLAY COLORS
===============================

As of QB Plus Version 1.1 you may change the colors used by QB Plus, and
save the selection in the QB Plus configuration file.

From the QB Plus main menu, choose the "<C>hange settings" option, then
the "<C>olor settings" option from the menu that follows.  The QB Plus
color selection screen permits both foreground and background color to be
chosen from one of the standard 16 text colors.  Most displays, however,
will recognize only the first 8 of the background colors.

Use the Up and Down cursor keys to vertically reposition the arrowhead on
screen to the corresponding choice in the Foregound color list.  Use the
right and left cursor keys to move between the Foregound list and the
adjacent Backgound list.  As you change lists the arrowhead indicator moves
to the new list leaving a checkmark in its place within the previous list.

"Sample Text" on screen previews your color changes as the arrowhead moves
from one color to another.

Press the Enter key to place your color selections into effect.  Otherwise
press Escape to leave the existing colors unchanged.

Selecting the "<S>ave settings" option will store your color selection in
the QB Plus configuration file to be used each time QB Plus is started.



KEYBOARD DELAY AND REPEAT RATES
===============================

QB Plus provides an option for use with AT-compatible systems to change
the keyboard's delay and repeat rate.  The new rate may be set automatically
when QB Plus is started.

From the QB Plus main menu, choose "<C>hange settings", then "<K>eyboard
settings" from the menu that follows.  Repeat rates range from 2 to 30
characters per second; delay rates from 250 to 1000 milliseconds at 250
millisecond intervals.

The up and down cursor keys toggle between the repeat and delay scales,
with a vertical arrowhead denoting the active scale.  Use the right and
left cursor keys to position the arrowhead at the desired value.

The "A" key toggles the Automatic Startup setting.  When enabled, QB Plus
automatically sets the keyboard to your desired rates at startup.  Then
when QB Plus ends, it automatically resets the rates to the defaults for
AT-class computers: 500 milliseconds delay and 10 characters per second
repeat rate.  You must use the "<S>ave settings" command which modifies the
QB Plus configuration file, for the Automatic Startup option to take effect.

If you do not enable and save the Automatic Startup setting, you will need
to set new rates manually in the Keyboard menu after QB plus is started.
However, with Automatic Startup disabled any new keyboard rate settings will
remain in effect after QB Plus ends, for use in other programs or later QB
Plus sessions.



AT-COMPATIBLE 8086/8088 BIOS
============================

QB Plus uses the Int 15h Get Extended Memory Size and also examines the CMOS
memory area to identify extended memory.  BIOS's which support this call
cause QB Plus to use the Int 15h Move function for memory viewing, which
will produce blanks on an 8088/8086 machine.  Setting the /NX switch (or
disabling Direct View in the configuration menu) overrides this behavior
and permits memory viewing.



QB PLUS REVISION HISTORY
========================

Version       Description

1.01        Support for German version of QB 4.5 incorporated.  Mouse data
