On October 26th, 2018 I purchased the software assets of Full Moon Software.
Full Moon Software used to be known as Crescent Software.  They produced a line
of excellent development libraries for MS-DOS.  The supported environments were
QuickBASIC 4.x, Microsoft Professional Development System v7.x, and Visual 
Basic for DOS.

The idea behind obtaining these products was to release them to the public
domain to ensure that people could still access these things in the future.
While most developers will have no use for these products in a modern 
develoment environment, they still have value as an example of "how it was 
done" back in the heyday of x86 DOS development. 

The software in this repository hasn't been modified from how I received it 
from Ethan Winer, the original author.  While all the source files carry some 
kind of Copyright notice, the software is now in the public domain.

The original distribution disk files and documentation are available here:

About Crescent Software:
After 20 years as a professional recording engineer and musician, Ethan
Winer founded Crescent Software in 1986, quickly building it to become the
leading provider of add-on products for use with Microsoft compiled BASIC
for DOS. During that time Ethan wrote numerous articles about DOS BASIC and
assembly language for all of the major programming magazines, and also
served as a contributing editor for PC Magazine. Ethan also received
Microsoft's MVP award every year since 1996 for his assistance in the
Microsoft BASIC programming newsgroups. In 1992 Ethan sold Crescent to his
partner Don Malin, and retired in order to pursue his musical interests.

Here's the QB Plus product description from the manual:

QB Plus is a collection of software accessories developed especially for
the QuickBASIC programmer.  QB Plus extends the QuickBASIC programming
environment by loading with it and remaining two keystrokes away while
editing the QuickBASIC program in memory.

Provided with QB Plus are accessories to view the contents of memory;
to record and playback keystrokes; to create executable programs using
any of the compiler and linker options; debug them using an external
debugger; and profile the execution of QuickBASIC programs to identify
bottlenecks.  Besides these built-in tools, the BASIC programmer can 
readily access other programs from within QB Plus.

QB Plus is designed to work with QuickBASIC 4.5; and the Basic Professional
Development System versions 7.0 and 7.1.
